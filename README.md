# Tanglish-Tweets-using-XLMRoberta-model

Apparently for the past week I have gained interest to learn Sentiment Analysis for some Godknowswhatreason so that's why I am doing this...
Basically Sentiment Analysis analyses the 'linguistic' part and tries to catagorize the text based on its emotions due to the fact that human povs and expressions avoid to be a constant value.
And this has fascinated me not going to lie but I wanted to try something different instad of a generic tweets that you aren't familiar with and gonna copy blindly anyway
That's when I saw this dataset in Kaggle--->
